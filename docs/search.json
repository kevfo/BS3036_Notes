    "text": "The immune system is like a superhero inside our bodies that protects us from harmful invaders. It has several important jobs to keep us healthy.\nFirstly, one of its main tasks is to defend us against tiny, unseen creatures called microbes that can make us sick. These can be viruses, bacteria, or other types of germs that try to enter our bodies.\nAnother important role of the immune system is to fight against abnormal cells that could turn into tumors or cells infected by pathogens. It acts like a security guard, ensuring that our cells stay healthy and don’t turn into troublemakers.\nHomeostasis is a big word, but it simply means that the immune system helps maintain balance in our body. It ensures that everything is working just right, like a thermostat keeping our body functions in check.\nLastly, the immune system is responsible for cleaning up after itself. It destroys cells that are no longer useful or have become damaged, like old red blood cells or white blood cells that are not fit for duty. It also gets rid of things like antigen-antibody complexes, which are like the aftermath of battles fought within our bodies."

    "section": "1.1 Innate Immunity",
    "text": "1.1 Innate Immunity\nInnate immunity is like the first-line defense team in our body, and it has some interesting features that help it act quickly against invaders.\nFirstly, it’s a non-specific responder, meaning it doesn’t target specific invaders but goes after a range of potential troublemakers. This rapid response is possible because it relies on components that are already present in the body.\nImagine it as a quick-reacting team that jumps into action within minutes of detecting an infection. However, this team doesn’t have a memory, so it reacts in the same way each time it encounters a threat, without learning from previous experiences. It’s like a brave squad that tackles different problems with the same set of tools.\nSurprisingly, innate immunity does not engage in clonal expansion, which means it doesn’t create an army of specialized cells to deal with a specific threat. Instead, it uses the same molecules and cells to respond to a variety of pathogens.\n\n1.1.1 Mechanisms Behind Innate Immunity\nThe mechanisms of innate immunity are like a team of superheroes working together to protect our body from invaders. These mechanisms involve physical barriers and specialized cells that play crucial roles in keeping us safe.\nFirstly, think of our skin as the ultimate fortress – it acts as a physical barrier that prevents most invaders from getting inside. Additionally, the acidic environment in our stomach is like a powerful shield that eliminates many pathogens. However, some crafty microbes, like helicobacter pylori, can still slip through these defenses.\nOur body also has a secret weapon in mucosal protection, which involves the production of antimicrobial peptides. These peptides act like guards, patrolling the mucous membranes and fighting off potential threats.\n\n\n\n\n\nImages of Cells of the Innate Immune System\n\n\n\n\nBut that’s not all; we have a team of cells that are always on the lookout for trouble. Natural killer cells are like snipers, targeting and eliminating infected cells. Neutrophils, macrophages, mast cells, basophils, and eosinophils are like the foot soldiers, each with its unique skills to combat different invaders. They patrol our body, ready to take action when needed:\n\n\n1.1.2 Neutrophils\n::: {.cell layout-align=\"center\"}\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n![Description and Image of a Neutrophil](../imgs/innate_cells.png){fig-align='center' width=473}\n:::\n:::\nNeutrophils, which are a type of white blood cells also known as polymorphonuclear leukocytes, are the frontline soldiers of our immune system. When activated, these cells perform essential functions to protect our body from harmful invaders.\nOne of their main duties is phagocytosis, a process where they engulf and digest bacteria. It’s like they’re the cleanup crew, devouring the invaders to keep our body safe. Additionally, neutrophils activate bactericidal mechanisms, meaning they unleash substances that can kill bacteria.\n\n\n\n\n\nNeutrophils in Action\n\n\n\n\nInside their arsenal of defense, neutrophils possess myeloperoxidase, a powerful enzyme that helps them produce reactive substances to combat microbes. Think of it as their secret weapon for creating a hostile environment for the invaders.\nSerine proteases are another tool in their toolkit. These enzymes assist in breaking down proteins, aiding in the destruction of bacteria and contributing to the overall cleanup mission.\nNeutrophils also deploy defensins, which are small proteins with antimicrobial properties. These proteins act like tiny guards, disrupting the integrity of bacterial cells and preventing them from causing harm.\nLastly, neutrophils release cytokines, signaling molecules that serve as messengers to coordinate the immune response. They communicate with other immune cells, rallying them to join the fight and ensuring a well-organized defense against the invaders.\n\n\n1.1.3 Macrophages\nMacrophages, another important type of white blood cell, are like the cleanup crew and information couriers of our immune system. When activated, they perform crucial functions to safeguard our body.\n\n\n\n\n\nMacrophages in Action\n\n\n\n\nOne of their primary tasks is phagocytosis, similar to neutrophils. Macrophages engulf and digest bacteria, acting as the body’s janitors to remove potential threats. Moreover, they activate bactericidal mechanisms, unleashing substances that can destroy bacteria and ensure a clean and safe environment.\nHowever, macrophages have an additional role that sets them apart – antigen presentation. Think of them as diplomats who gather information about invaders. After phagocytosing bacteria, macrophages break down these invaders into fragments, or antigens. They then present these antigens to other immune cells, like T cells, essentially saying, “Look, this is what the enemy looks like; let’s mount a coordinated defense.”\n\n1.1.3.1 Phagocytosis\n\n\n\n\n\nPhagocytosis in Action\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nInterleukins Secreted During Phagocytosis\n\n\n\n\nWhen phacytosis happens, a number of compounds of called interleukins are secreted - some of which include IL-1\\(\\beta\\), TNF-\\(\\alpha\\), IL-6, IL-8 (or CXCL8), and IL-12 and result in the following effects:\n\nLymphocytes are activated\nVascular structures (i.e., blood vessels) become more permeable to immune cells, antibodies, and fluids.\nAntibodies are also produced\nNeutrophils, basophils, and T cells are called to the site of infection.\nNK (i.e., Natural Killer) cells cause CD4 T cells to turn into TH1 cells.\n\nThe first three effects mentioned above induce fever and lead to the production of IL-6, the movement of nutrients around the body, and also protein production.\n\n\n\n1.1.4 Natural Killer Cells\n\n\n\n\n\nNatural Killer Cells\n\n\n\n\nNatural Killer (NK) cells are like the assassins of the immune system, and when activated, they have a specific and deadly function against virus-infected cells.\nWhen NK cells encounter cells infected by viruses, they release lytic granules. These granules contain powerful substances that act like tiny bombs, targeting and killing the infected cells. It’s as if the NK cells are launching a precise and targeted attack on the cells that have been hijacked by viruses.\n\n\n\n\n\nMechanisms of Killing NK Cells\n\n\n\n\nWhen an NK cells interacts with a healthy cell (i.e., as seen above), it also has an MHC molecule that interacts with the NK cell’s inhibitory receptor along with an activating ligand that interacts with the NK cell’s activating receptor.\n\n\n\n\n\nImmune Cells of the Human Immune System\n\n\n\n\nIn the case of a virus-infected cell, a cancerous cell, or a cell to be destroyed by the NK cell, the cell in question lacks an MHC molecule and hence, is unable to inactivate the NK cell (consequently leading to lysis).\n\n\n\n\n\nNK Cells Killing a Parasite\n\n\n\n\nIt should be noted that eosinophils, basophils, and neutrophils have more than one nuclei within them (i.e., polymorphonuclear leukocytes) while mast cells only have one nuclei (i.e., mono-nuclear leukocytes).\n\n1.1.4.1 Early Stages of Infection\n\n\n\n\n\nNK Cells in the Early Stages of Infection\n\n\n\n\nDuring the early stages of infection, NK cells may be activated by IL-12 secretions by macrophages. This subsequently causes the activated NK cells to produce INF-\\(\\gamma\\).\n\n\n\n\n\nNK Cell Activation from Cytokines from Dendritic Cells\n\n\n\n\nMoreover, NK cells can also be activated by molecules called cytokines by dendritic cells."

    "text": "1.2 Adaptive Immunity\nAdaptive immunity is like the strategic reserve force of our immune system, and it kicks in as the second line of defense against invaders. It’s a specific and powerful response that takes a bit of time to deploy.\nUnlike the rapid response of innate immunity, adaptive immunity is a slow but highly targeted process that unfolds over several days. It relies on genetic events and cellular growth to develop a precise and effective defense strategy.\nOne of the standout features of adaptive immunity is its specificity. Each cell involved in this response is like a specialized detective that recognizes and responds to a specific part of an invader, known as an epitope on an antigen. It’s like having a unique key for each lock, ensuring that the immune system can tailor its response to different types of threats.\nAdaptive immunity also has a remarkable memory. After being exposed to an invader once, the immune system remembers it. This memory allows for a faster and stronger response upon repeated exposure to the same threat. It’s as if the immune system learns from previous encounters, making it more efficient at dealing with familiar foes.\nFurthermore, adaptive immunity leads to clonal expansion. This means that when a specific threat is recognized, the immune system produces a large army of specialized cells targeted to combat that specific invader. It’s like recruiting and training a dedicated force for a particular mission.\n\n1.2.1 Mechanisms\nAdaptive immunity operates through two key mechanisms, each with specialized cells that play vital roles in defending the body against invaders.\n\n\n\n\n\nDifferences Between the Specific and the Non-Specific Immune Responses\n\n\n\n\nThe cell-mediated immune response involves T-cells, which can be thought of as the coordinators and warriors of the immune system. There are two main types of T-cells:\n\nHelper T cells: Imagine them as generals directing the overall strategy. These cells help orchestrate the immune response by releasing signals that activate other immune cells. They’re like the commanders who provide instructions to the troops.\nCytotoxic T cells: Picture them as the elite soldiers. These cells are directly involved in destroying infected or abnormal cells. They recognize and eliminate cells that have been marked for destruction. It’s like having a specialized force that goes after specific targets.\n\nOn the other hand, the humoral immune response involves B-cells, which are like the factories producing weapons for the immune system.\n\nB cells: These are the antibody-producing factories. When activated, B cells transform into plasma cells, churning out antibodies. Antibodies are like smart missiles that lock onto specific invaders and neutralize them. B cells are like the arms manufacturers of the immune system, producing the weapons needed to target and eliminate threats.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIllustration of Dendritic Cells\n\n\n\n\nThe thing about dendritic cells in the adaptive immune system is that they excel at presenting antigens.\n\n\n\n\n\nLineages of the Immune Cell\n\n\n\n\nT cells are part of the adaptive immune system whereas the cells in the green box are part of the innate immune system.\n\n\n1.2.2 Monocytes\nMonocytes are a special type of white blood cells characterized by their kidney bean-shaped nucleus. These cells serve as versatile responders in our immune system, particularly during times of infection and inflammation.\nWhen the body signals the presence of an infection or inflammation, monocytes act swiftly by moving to the affected sites in a manner dependent on a molecule called CCR2. Once they reach these sites, monocytes can undergo a transformation, differentiating into other essential immune cells, namely macrophages and dendritic cells.\nMacrophages are like the cleanup crew, devouring invaders and maintaining a clean environment, while dendritic cells act as messengers, presenting information about the invaders to other immune cells.\n\n\n\n\n\nLocation of HSCs\n\n\n\n\nMonocytes are not only agile responders but also versatile communicators. They have the ability to produce cytokines, which are signaling molecules that can be either anti-inflammatory (calming the immune response) or pro-inflammatory (activating and intensifying the immune response). This flexibility allows them to modulate the overall immune response based on the specific needs of the situation.\nThese cells are born in the bone marrow and circulate in the bloodstream, ready to be deployed when needed. They play a crucial role in the body’s defense against infections, swiftly responding to signals, transforming into different immune cells, and contributing to the regulation of the immune response.\n\n\n1.2.3 Lymph Nodes\n\n1.2.3.1 Bacterial Infection of a Lymph Node\n\n\n\n\n\nBacterial Infection of Lymph Nodes"

This distinctive shape allows antibodies to bind to specific invaders, known as antigens. Antigens are typically proteins, polysaccharides, lipids, or nucleic acids combined with proteins.\nEach antibody is like a specialized soldier, and the specificity of its target is determined by the unique combination of heavy and light chains. It’s similar to having a lock-and-key system, where each antibody fits perfectly with a specific antigen.\nInterestingly, the immune system is equipped with a diverse army of B cells, each expressing B cell receptors (BCRs) with a distinct specificity for particular antigens. When a B cell encounters its matching antigen, it undergoes activation and transforms into a plasma cell, which is a factory for producing antibodies.\n\n1.3.1 Antibody Functions\n\n\n\n\n\nDifferent Functions of Antibodies\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDifferent Functions of Antibodies\n\n\n\n\nAntibodies come in five different types: IgA, IgG, IgM, IgE, and IgD.

    "section": "1.4 Cell-Mediated Immune Response",
    "text": "1.4 Cell-Mediated Immune Response\nThe cell-mediated immune response involves T-cells, which are crucial players in recognizing and responding to specific threats. Here’s how T-cells operate in this intricate defense mechanism:\n\nRecognition of Peptide Antigens: T-cells have a unique ability to recognize peptide antigens presented by antigen-presenting cells (APCs). These peptides are usually fragments of proteins from pathogens or other foreign invaders.\nAssociation with Major Histocompatibility Complex (MHC): Antigen presentation occurs in conjunction with major histocompatibility complexes (MHC). For CD4 T-cells, which are also known as helper T-cells, antigen presentation happens on MHC class II molecules. This interaction is essential for activating CD4 T-cells.\nSpecificity and Activation: Antigen-presenting cells, particularly dendritic cells, present peptides to CD4 T-cells, providing them with crucial information about the invader. This interaction activates CD4 T-cells, turning them into effective coordinators of the immune response.\nRecognition by CD8 T-cells: Some specific APCs, including dendritic cell subsets, also present peptides on MHC class I molecules. This interaction licenses CD8 T-cells, enabling them to recognize and eliminate infected or abnormal cells.\nUniversal Peptide Presentation: Interestingly, almost all cells in the body (except mature red blood cells) have the capability to present peptides on MHC class I molecules. This allows T-cells to constantly survey the body for abnormalities, ensuring that infected or malfunctioning cells are targeted for destruction.\n\n\n1.4.1 T-Cells\n\n\n\n\n\nT Cells\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nClonal Expansion\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nOverview of the Immune Response\n\n\n\n\nT lymphocytes, commonly known as T cells, are a crucial component of the immune system, and they can be classified into different types, each with specific functions.\n\nHelper T-Lymphocytes (CD4+): These are often referred to as “helper” T cells. The designation CD4+ indicates a specific protein found on the surface of these cells. Helper T cells play a central role in coordinating the immune response. They assist in activating other immune cells, including other T cells, phagocytes, and B cells. Think of them as the generals guiding the overall strategy of the immune system.\nCytolytic T-Lymphocytes (CD8+): Also known as cytotoxic T cells, these are identified by the presence of the CD8 protein. Their primary role is to destroy infected cells that harbor microbes or microbial proteins. Cytotoxic T cells are like the special forces, targeting and eliminating cells that have been hijacked by pathogens.\n\nBoth CD4+ and CD8+ T cells are critical for a well-coordinated immune response. They work together to recognize and combat infections:\n\nAntigen Recognition: T cells recognize antigens, which are usually peptide fragments of proteins derived from pathogens.\nActivation of Helper T Cells (CD4+): Helper T cells play a key role in activating other immune cells. They facilitate communication between different components of the immune system, ensuring a coherent and effective response.\nActivation of Cytotoxic T Cells (CD8+): When a cell is infected, cytotoxic T cells are activated to eliminate the infected cells, preventing the spread of the infection.\n\n\n\n1.4.2 Primary and Secondary Immune Responses\nThe immune system has two distinct but interconnected responses to an infection: the primary immune response and the secondary immune response.\nPrimary Immune Response: - Effector Cells and Memory Cells: During the primary immune response, the body generates specific clones of effector cells, which are the cells directly involved in combating the infection. Additionally, memory cells are produced, which “remember” the specific pathogen encountered. These memory cells play a crucial role in the secondary immune response.\n\nDevelopment Time: The primary response takes some time to develop, typically occurring over several days. This delay is due to the initial activation and expansion of immune cells specific to the encountered pathogen.\nInfection Elimination: Although the primary response may take a while to fully activate, it eventually contributes to the elimination of the infection. Effector cells work to control and eliminate the invading pathogen.\n\nSecondary Immune Response: - Pronounced and Faster: The secondary immune response is characterized by being more pronounced and faster compared to the primary response. This heightened efficiency is a result of the presence of memory cells that “remember” the specific pathogen from the initial encounter.\n\nMore Effective: The secondary response is more effective at limiting the infection. Memory cells recognize the pathogen quickly and mount a swift and robust immune response. This rapid response is often so efficient that it can prevent the infection from causing noticeable symptoms.\nImmunological Memory: One key feature of the secondary immune response is immunological memory. Memory cells “remember” the previous encounter with the pathogen, allowing for a faster and more potent response upon re-exposure. This memory is the basis for vaccines, which aim to stimulate the immune system to produce memory cells without causing the disease itself."

    "section": "1.5 Vaccines",
    "text": "1.5 Vaccines\n\n\n\n\n\nHow do Vaccines Work?\n\n\n\n\nVaccines are designed to train the immune system to recognize and defend against specific pathogens, such as viruses or bacteria. Here’s a step-by-step explanation of how vaccines work:\n\nIntroduction of Vaccine Particles: When a person receives a vaccine, it contains harmless fragments or weakened forms of the targeted pathogen. These vaccine particles serve as mimics that resemble the actual pathogen but don’t cause the disease itself.\nUptake by Dendritic Cells: Dendritic cells, specialized immune cells, are responsible for capturing and presenting foreign particles to the immune system. They take up the vaccine particles and migrate to lymph nodes.\nActivation of Adaptive Immune Response: In the lymph nodes, dendritic cells present the vaccine particles to T-cells, specifically activating the adaptive immune response. This involves the activation of both helper T-cells (CD4+) and cytotoxic T-cells (CD8+).\nT-Cell Activation: Activated helper T-cells play a central role in coordinating the immune response. They stimulate B-cells and cytotoxic T-cells. Cytotoxic T-cells are responsible for recognizing and eliminating infected cells.\nRecognition by B-Cells: B-cells, another type of immune cell, recognize the vaccine particles directly. They become activated and transform into plasma cells, which are factories for producing antibodies.\nProduction of Antibodies: Antibodies are proteins produced by plasma cells in response to the vaccine. These antibodies specifically target and neutralize the vaccine particles. Additionally, they are equipped to recognize and neutralize the actual pathogen if encountered in the future.\nFormation of Memory Cells: The immune system not only generates effector cells (plasma cells producing antibodies) but also forms memory T- and B-cells. These memory cells “remember” the specific characteristics of the pathogen, providing long-lasting immunity.\nPreparedness for Future Exposure: With memory T- and B-cells in place, the host’s immune system is primed and ready to mount a rapid and effective immune response upon subsequent exposure to the actual pathogen. This preparedness is what confers immunity and protects the individual from developing severe illness or complications.\n\n\n1.5.1 Influenza Vaccine\n\n\n\n\n\nFlu Virus Diagram\n\n\n\n\nInfluenza viruses are classified into several types and subtypes based on their genetic and surface protein characteristics. Here’s an overview of the main types and some key distinctions:\n\nTypes of Influenza Virus:\n\nType A and Type B: These are the primary types associated with seasonal epidemics in humans. Influenza A viruses are further categorized into subtypes based on their surface proteins, hemagglutinin (H) and neuraminidase (N). Influenza B viruses do not have subtypes but are classified into two main lineages: Yamagata and Victoria. Infections with these types and subtypes are typically responsible for the seasonal flu.\nType C: Influenza C causes milder symptoms and is less common than Types A and B.\nType D: This type is mainly found in pigs and cattle, and human infections are extremely rare.\n\nInfluenza A – Subtypes (H#N#):\n\nThe subtypes of influenza A are determined by the combinations of two viral surface proteins: hemagglutinin (H) and neuraminidase (N).\nHemagglutinin (H) has 18 subtypes (H1-H18).\nNeuraminidase (N) has 11 subtypes (N1-N11).\nThe naming convention for influenza A viruses includes the H and N subtypes, such as H1N1 or H3N2.\n\nInfluenza B – Lineages:\n\nInfluenza B viruses do not have subtypes but are classified into two lineages: Yamagata and Victoria.\nThese lineages help in characterizing and tracking different strains of influenza B.\n\nNaming Convention:\n\nThe Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) follows an internationally accepted naming convention for influenza viruses.\nThe naming convention includes the type, geographical origin, strain number, and year of isolation. For example, A/Perth/16/2009 (H3N2) indicates an influenza A virus of human origin, subtype H3N2, isolated in Perth in 2009.\n\n\n\n\n1.5.2 Why is it So Hard to Make a Flu Vaccine?\n\n\n\n\n\nSequence of Immune Events During a Viral Infection\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWhy it’s difficult to make a Flu Vaccine\n\n\n\n\nLong story short, the virus changes quickly via something called antigenic shift."

    "section": "",
    "text": "“The immune system is like the military that protects your body, or your homeland, against invaders and prevents invaders, such as viruses and bacteria, from coming in, taking over and trying to take down your homeland.”\n– Dr. Tory Torgerson\n\nOur body has a super cool defense team called the innate immune system. Think of it like a superhero squad that works 24/7 to keep us safe from harmful invaders like bacteria and viruses. One way they do this is by using an “avoidance strategy.”\nImagine our body as a fortress, and the innate immune system builds strong walls and sets up barriers to keep out the bad guys. These barriers are like shields, and they’re found in places like our skin, mouth, respiratory system (which includes our lungs), and intestines. The goal is to stop these invaders from getting inside and causing trouble.\nThese barriers aren’t just walls; they also have special agents, like antimicrobial proteins, that act like secret weapons. These proteins are like the guards of the fortress, patrolling and making sure no invaders sneak in. So, not only do the barriers physically block the way, but they also have backup plans to strengthen the defense even more.\n\n\n\nNow, let’s talk about the second part of our immune system’s strategy – the resistance strategy. Imagine this as the superhero squad going into action when some invaders manage to sneak past the initial barriers.\nOnce these bad guys get inside our fortress (our body), the innate immune system switches to a resistance strategy. The goal here is to reduce or eliminate these troublemakers – kind of like fighting off the enemy inside the castle.\nThe superhero cells in our body, activated by the innate immune system, have two main ways of dealing with the invaders. First, they can directly attack and destroy the bad guys. This might involve swallowing them up or releasing special chemicals that are like toxic weapons against the invaders.\nThe second way is to send signals to other immune cells, kind of like calling for backup. These backup cells then join the fight and help in getting rid of the invaders. It’s like a teamwork strategy, where different immune cells work together to make sure the invaders are taken down.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHow a Dendritic Cell Activates CD8+ Helper Cells\n\n\n\n\nNow, let’s dive into the next level of our immune system – the adaptive immune response. Think of B and T cells as the special forces, the elite units of our immune system. These cells are like highly trained commandos that launch specific and targeted attacks against invaders.\nWhat makes B and T cells so cool is their ability to remember their enemies. It’s like having a superhero memory for future assaults. Once these cells encounter a specific invader, they learn all about it and keep that information stored for a long time. So, if the same invader tries to attack again, our immune system can recognize it quickly and launch a swift and powerful counterattack.\nThese special forces are amazing at eliminating pathogens that might have slipped past the initial defenses or overwhelmed the innate immune system. They are super specific, meaning each B or T cell is trained to recognize and attack a particular invader. It’s like having a specialized team for every type of enemy.\nHowever, there’s a catch – these special forces take some time to gear up. Unlike the innate immune response that acts quickly, the adaptive immune response is a bit slow to develop. It takes a few days for B and T cells to get ready for action. But once they’re in the game, they provide a strong and targeted defense, and they remember their enemies for future showdowns. It’s like having a personalized army ready to protect us with precision!\n\n\n\nThe innate immune response is like the body’s quick and tough bouncer at the entrance of a club, keeping out unwanted party crashers.\n\nFirst Line of Defense: Think of it as the first layer of protection, always on guard to stop invaders (like germs) from getting in.\nRapid Response: This defense team acts super fast, within minutes of spotting a threat. It’s like having an emergency response team that jumps into action right away.\nQuick Elimination: The innate immune response aims to kick out invaders ASAP or at least keep them in check until the big guns (adaptive immune response) arrive. It’s all about buying time to get things under control.\nNon-Specific: Unlike the adaptive immune response, which is like a specialized SWAT team, the innate response isn’t picky. It recognizes common signs of trouble but doesn’t pinpoint specific enemies.\nLimited Repertoire: Picture it having a set of basic tools. The innate system uses pattern recognition to identify general danger signs caused by invaders, like a detective recognizing a criminal’s usual tactics.\nActivating Backup: When the situation gets too intense, the innate response signals the adaptive immune response, kind of like calling in reinforcements. Teamwork makes the dream work!"

    "text": "2.2 Pattern Recognition by Innate Immune Cells\nImagine our immune cells as smart detectives always on the lookout for trouble. They use special tools called Pattern Recognition Receptors (PRRs) to identify the bad guys. These PRRs are like the detective’s keen senses, strategically placed in two main locations:\n\nOn the Cell Surface: Think of this as the outer radar system, scanning for trouble outside the cells. It helps in spotting invaders that are trying to attack from the extracellular (outside the cell) space.\nInside the Cell (Endosomes/Cytoplasm): Now, picture an inner security system. This part detects invaders that manage to sneak inside the cell, keeping an eye on potential threats within.\n\nThese PRRs are like a smart filter looking for specific patterns called Pathogen-Associated Molecular Patterns (PAMPs). PAMPs are like the bad guy’s signature moves – regular patterns found on many invaders but not on our own cells. It’s a way for our immune system to shout, “Hey, you don’t belong here!”\nBut there’s a twist – our immune cells aren’t just focused on invaders. They can also spot signs of trouble within our own cells. They do this by recognizing Damage-Associated Molecular Patterns (DAMPs). DAMPs are like distress signals, indicating that something might be wrong due to infection, damage, or stress.\n\n2.2.1 Toll-Like Receptors\n\n\n\n\n\nSome Toll-Like Receptors\n\n\n\n\nToll-like receptors (TLRs) act like the superheroes of our immune system, with 10 genes in humans (and 12 in mice), each possessing a unique ability to recognize specific bad-guy moves known as Pathogen-Associated Molecular Patterns (PAMPs). These receptors are versatile, able to identify elements from a variety of troublemakers, making them like superheroes with a broad skill set. Positioned on the outer walls of cells, TLRs primarily guard against extracellular microbial products, acting as vigilant watchers over the fortress.\nStructurally, TLRs are transmembrane proteins equipped with an outer region composed of leucine-rich repeats (LRR), functioning like receptors that can spot specific patterns associated with invaders. When a threat is detected, TLRs don’t hesitate to activate a response by forming duos or altering their shape, similar to triggering an alarm system.\n\n\n\n\n\nDepiction of Toll-Like Domain\n\n\n\n\nInside the cell, TLRs wield a Toll-IL-1 receptor (TIR) domain, allowing them to communicate with other signaling molecules – a crucial element for teamwork in the immune system. In essence, TLRs are the special agents patrolling the perimeter, each with its own unique power, ready to activate the immune response when danger is sensed.\n\n2.2.1.1 Cell Surface\n\n\n\n\n\nTOLL Receptors on the Cell Surface\n\n\n\n\nTLRs on the cell surface are like sentinels, each specializing in detecting specific threats. Here are some key players:\n\nTLR-1, 2, 6: Think of these as a trio of guardians. They get activated by certain signals, such as lipoteichoic acid, diacyl, and triacyl lipoproteins commonly found in the outer layers of certain bacteria. TLR-2 can team up with either TLR-1 or TLR-6 to enhance its detective skills.\nTLR-4: This one is a key player in dealing with bacterial infections. It’s like the expert detective that recognizes lipopolysaccharide (LPS), a characteristic feature of many Gram-negative bacteria. Interestingly, TLR-4 also has a versatile side – it can identify the Spike protein of the SARS-CoV-2 virus, the culprit behind COVID-19.\nActivation Team: TLR-4 doesn’t work alone; it needs backup. For activation, it teams up with accessory proteins called MD-2 and CD14. It’s like having a dynamic trio working together to make sure the response is efficient.\n\n\n\n2.2.1.2 Endosomes\n\n\n\n\n\nToll-Like Receptors in the Endosomes\n\n\n\n\nImagine endosomes as a special compartment within our cells, acting like a high-security zone to detect specific viral threats. Here are the key players:\n\nTLR-3: This detective specializes in recognizing double-stranded RNA (dsRNA), a kind of genetic material that many viruses use during their replication. It’s like TLR-3 is on the lookout for the blueprint of viral mischief. When the cell engulfs viruses or dying cells, TLR-3 encounters dsRNA in the endosome, triggering the alarm.\nTLR-7 and 8: These dynamic duo detectives are experts in spotting single-stranded RNA (ssRNA) found in virus genomes, such as those from orthomyxoviruses like influenza. It’s like they have a keen eye for the unique signatures of certain viral intruders.\nTLR-9: Picture TLR-9 as the guardian of genetic code. It recognizes unmethylated CpG dinucleotides, which are like specific markers found in the DNA of bacteria and many viruses. TLR-9 acts like a genetic detective, identifying these markers to signal potential trouble.\n\n\n\n\n2.2.2 Nod-Like Receptors\n\n\n\n\n\nIllustration of Nod Receptors\n\n\n\n\nNOD-like receptors (NLRs) are cellular guardians, stationed within the cell’s cytoplasm, acting as vigilant detectors of potential threats. These receptors can be categorized into subfamilies based on the protein domains they carry. All NLRs share a central nucleotide-binding oligomerization domain (NOD), functioning as the core of their surveillance equipment. The NOD subfamily, represented by members like NOD1 and NOD2, includes an additional amino-terminal caspase recruitment domain (CARD), acting as a communication device to coordinate responses when danger is detected.\nAnother subfamily, NLRP, features members like NLRP3, which replaces the CARD domain with a pyrin domain at their amino termini. This pyrin domain serves a similar communication function, allowing NLRP members to effectively coordinate cellular responses. In essence, NLRs are like an internal security team strategically positioned within our cells, equipped with specific tools such as the NOD domain, and additional domains like CARD or pyrin, to ensure a swift and coordinated response against potential threats.\n\n2.2.2.1 Nod Subfamily\n\n\n\n\n\nNod Sensing\n\n\n\n\nThe NOD subfamily, comprising NOD1 and NOD2, acts as a specialized defense team within our cells, tuned to recognize specific signals from bacteria. NOD1 is like a vigilant detector set to pick up on γ-glutamyl diaminopimelic acid (iE-DAP), a substance found in the breakdown of peptidoglycans from both Gram-negative bacteria like Salmonella and some Gram-positive bacteria like Listeria. On the other hand, NOD2 specializes in recognizing muramyl dipeptide (MDP), a component present in the peptidoglycans of most bacteria. These NOD ligands can enter the cell’s cytoplasm through various pathways, including intracellular infection or transportation from materials captured through endocytosis.\nNOD proteins play a critical role in cells that are routinely exposed to bacteria, such as epithelial cells forming barriers that bacteria must navigate to establish an infection in the body. When NOD1 or NOD2 detects their respective ligands, a well-coordinated sequence of events unfolds to amplify the immune response. This includes the recruitment of serine-threonine kinase RIP2, which, in turn, associates with E3 ligases (cIAP1, cIAP2, and XIAP) to generate a polyubiquitin scaffold. This scaffold recruits additional players like TAK1 and IKK, leading to the activation of NF-kB, a key regulator of immune responses. The activated pathway also results in the production of nitric oxide (NO), a potent substance that is toxic to bacteria and intracellular parasites.\n\n\n2.2.2.2 NLRP3\n\n\n\n\n\nNLRP3 Activation\n\n\n\n\nThe activation of NLRP3, a crucial component in our body’s defense system, involves a two-step process requiring distinct signals. The first signal, known as priming, is triggered by cytokines or Pathogen-Associated Molecular Patterns (PAMPs). This initial signal leads to the transcriptional upregulation of key components of the NLRP3 inflammasome, including NLRP3 itself, pro-IL-1β, and pro-IL-18. Additionally, post-translational modifications are applied to NLRP3 during priming, essentially preparing and fine-tuning these components for activation.\nThe second signal, referred to as activation, is provided by either PAMPs or Damage-Associated Molecular Patterns (DAMPs), such as particulates, crystals, potassium efflux, and ATP. These signals induce the full activation of NLRP3 and the formation of the inflammasome. This activation step is crucial for unleashing the full defensive power of the NLRP3 inflammasome, allowing it to effectively respond to potential threats.\n\n\n\n\n\nNLRP3’s Role in Inflammasome Production\n\n\n\n\nWithin the NLRP subfamily, NLRP3 takes center stage as a critical sensor in the immune defense mechanism. This subfamily, comprising NLRP3 (sensor), ASC (adaptor), and Caspase-1 (effector), collaboratively forms the NLRP3 inflammasome complex. This complex acts as a molecular powerhouse that responds to danger signals within the cell.\nUpon activation, Caspase-1, a key player in this complex, springs into action. Activated Caspase-1 serves as a molecular scissors, cleaving inactive pro-IL-1β and pro-IL-18 into their active forms. These activated cytokines are then released into the cellular environment, contributing to the inflammatory response.\nFurthermore, Caspase-1 showcases its multitasking abilities by also cleaving and activating gasdermin D (GSDMD). The activated GSDMD undergoes a transformative process where its N-terminal domain (GSDMD-NT) oligomerizes, forming pores in the cell membrane. This unique mechanism leads to a form of programmed cell death known as pyroptosis. Pyroptosis is an inflammatory and lytic type of cell death, adding an extra layer to the defense strategy by eliminating infected cells in a way that alerts the immune system.\n\n\n\n2.2.3 RIG-I-Like Receptors (i.e., RLRs)\n\n\n\n\n\nDepiction of RLR Mechanisms\n\n\n\n\nRIG-I-like receptors (RLRs) are like specialized guards within our cells, specifically designed to detect the presence of viruses. Unlike some other detectors, such as TLR-3, 7, and 9, which identify viral RNAs and DNAs outside the cell, RLRs focus on sensing viral RNAs produced within the cells themselves.\nOne key player in the RLR team is RIG-I, which acts as a discrimination expert between host and viral RNA by detecting differences at the 5’ end of single-stranded RNA transcripts. Most RNA viruses carry unmodified 5’-triphosphate single-stranded RNA, making it a distinctive signature for RIG-I to recognize.\nAnother member of the RLR team is MDA-5, which has a unique ability to sense double-stranded RNA. Together, RIG-I and MDA-5 act as vigilant guards in the cell’s cytoplasm, detecting viral RNAs and initiating a crucial defense mechanism.\nWhen RIG-I or MDA-5 senses viral RNAs in the cytoplasm, it triggers the production of type I interferons. These interferons play a vital role in the body’s defense against viral infections, serving as signaling molecules that alert neighboring cells to prepare for the impending viral threat."

    "section": "2.3 Innate Immune Cells",
    "text": "2.3 Innate Immune Cells\n\n2.3.1 Macrophages\n\n\n\n\n\nMacropahge Populations on Flow Cytometry Plots\n\n\n\n\nMacrophages play a crucial role in our body’s defense, forming a three-dimensional network within every tissue. These versatile cells are on constant patrol, actively seeking out pathogens and eliminating dead cells. Remarkably long-lived, macrophages originate from fetal liver or yolk sac progenitors during embryonic development and continue to self-renew under normal conditions.\nDuring infections or inflammation, circulating monocytes come to the rescue, replenishing macrophage populations. One of the key tasks of macrophages is phagocytosis, where they engulf and neutralize invading microorganisms. Additionally, macrophages serve as the cleanup crew for the immune system, disposing of pathogens and infected cells targeted by the adaptive immune response, ensuring the removal of debris.\nNot only are macrophages skilled at phagocytosis, but they also act as inflammatory mediators by secreting cytokines and chemokines. This secretion induces a state of inflammation in the tissue, attracting other immune cells like monocytes and neutrophils to the site of infection. Furthermore, macrophages facilitate the entry of plasma proteins from the blood into the tissue, contributing to the overall immune response.\n\n2.3.1.1 Phagocytosis\n\n\n\n\n\nSteps Involved in Phagocytosis\n\n\n\n\nPhagocytosis is a remarkable process by which our immune cells, particularly phagocytes, engulf and neutralize invading microbes. The initiation of phagocytosis occurs when specific receptors on the cell surface interact with the surface of the microbial intruders.\nOnce the pathogen is recognized, the phagocyte surrounds it with its plasma membrane, creating a protective pocket known as a phagosome. This phagosome then internalizes the bound pathogen, forming a large membrane-enclosed vesicle within the cell.\n\n\n\n\n\nCompounds Produced During Phagocytosis\n\n\n\n\nThe next step in this cellular defense dance involves the phagosome fusing with lysosomes, resulting in the formation of a phagolysosome. Within the phagolysosome, lysosomal contents are released, creating an environment rich in antimicrobial peptides and enzymes. This fusion process is accompanied by acidification, making the phagolysosome an inhospitable space for the microbe.\nTo ensure the efficient neutralization of the microbe, enzymatic processes take place within the phagolysosome. These processes produce highly reactive substances such as superoxide and nitric oxide radicals, working together to effectively kill the intruding microorganism.\n\n\n\n2.3.2 Neutrophils\n\n\n\n\n\nImages of Neutrophils\n\n\n\n\nNeutrophils, the most abundant circulating leukocytes in humans, are a crucial part of our immune system. While abundant in the blood, they are not typically found in healthy tissues. These short-lived cells have a lifespan of only a few hours in circulation, necessitating constant replenishment from the bone marrow.\nNeutrophils play a significant role in phagocytosis, the process of engulfing and neutralizing invading microbes. After accomplishing a round of phagocytosis and utilizing their primary and secondary granules, neutrophils have a brief existence and die off.\nThese highly phagocytic cells employ NADPH oxidase (NOX2) to generate reactive oxygen species (ROS) upon activation, contributing to their antimicrobial capabilities. Neutrophils contain various cytoplasmic granules, including primary and secondary granules, which house myeloperoxidase (MPO), hydrolytic enzymes (such as elastase, lysozyme, and matrix metalloproteinases), and other antimicrobial proteins and peptides like lactoferrin and defensins.\nIn addition to phagocytosis, neutrophils exhibit a unique defense mechanism called NET release. NETs (Neutrophil Extracellular Traps) are structures composed of DNA, histones, and antimicrobial proteins released by neutrophils to trap and neutralize microbes outside the cell.\n\n2.3.2.1 Neutrophil Migration and Chemotaxis\n\n\n\n\n\nNeutrophil Migration Process\n\n\n\n\nThe process of neutrophil migration and chemotaxis involves a well-coordinated dance within the infected tissue. When infection occurs, selectin is induced on the endothelial surface. Neutrophils, the immune system’s rapid responders, engage in a rolling motion along the vascular endothelium, facilitated by selectin-mediated transient interactions.\nHowever, this interaction is relatively weak and cannot firmly anchor neutrophils against the shearing force caused by the flow of blood. Consequently, neutrophils continue to roll along the endothelium, creating a dynamic and continuous cycle of making and breaking contact. This rolling motion is crucial for the efficient recruitment of neutrophils to the site of infection, allowing them to scan and assess the environment for signals that guide them toward the source of the infection.\n\n\n2.3.2.2 Neutrophil Extracellular Traps (i.e., NETs)\n\n\n\n\n\nNET Formation\n\n\n\n\nNeutrophil Extracellular Traps (NETs) represent a fascinating and powerful weapon in the immune system’s arsenal. When neutrophils become activated during infection, some undergo a distinctive form of cell death. In this process, the neutrophils release their DNA, along with antimicrobial molecules, into the extracellular space, weaving a fibril matrix known as Neutrophil Extracellular Traps or NETs.\nThe primary function of NETs is to act as a net-like structure that captures microorganisms. Once ensnared in the NETs, these pathogens can be more efficiently phagocytosed by other immune cells, such as neutrophils or macrophages. Additionally, NETs are enriched with antimicrobial substances, including granule proteins like neutrophil elastase, myeloperoxidase (MPO), and S100 proteins, enhancing their ability to neutralize and eliminate pathogens.\nThe formation of NETs is a specialized process called NETosis, and it represents a unique strategy employed by neutrophils to contribute to the immune response. NETosis allows neutrophils to sacrifice themselves for the greater good, creating a physical barrier and releasing antimicrobial weapons to immobilize and combat invading microorganisms.\n\n\n\n2.3.3 Dendritic Cells\nDendritic cells (DCs) are a diverse group, featuring two primary functional types: conventional dendritic cells (cDCs) and plasmacytoid dendritic cells (pDCs). These cells originate from progenitors within the bone marrow and journey through the bloodstream to various tissues throughout the body, as well as to peripheral lymphoid organs.\nThe primary role of dendritic cells is as antigen-presenting cells (APCs). They play a pivotal role in processing microbes they ingest, generating peptide antigens capable of activating T cells and initiating adaptive immune responses. Furthermore, dendritic cells respond to microbial recognition by producing cytokines, which serve to activate or polarize other cell types involved in the immune response.\nDendritic cells serve as essential bridges between innate and adaptive immunity, orchestrating communication and cooperation between different components of the immune system.\n\n\n\n\n\nDendritic Cells in the Mature and Immature States\n\n\n\n\nIn a steady state, dendritic cells (DCs) remain in an immature state, poised as vigilant sentinels of the immune system. They are tasked with recognizing a diverse array of danger signals emanating from invading pathogens and tissues through Pattern Recognition Receptors (PRRs).\nDespite their crucial role in immune surveillance, immature dendritic cells exhibit low surface expression of major histocompatibility complex (MHC) class II molecules and co-stimulatory molecules such as CD80 and CD86. These molecules are vital for activating T cells and orchestrating effective immune responses. However, in their immature state, dendritic cells maintain a poised readiness, awaiting signals that trigger their maturation and enable them to initiate adaptive immune responses when needed.\n\n\n\n\n\nOverview of What Dendritic Cells Do\n\n\n\n\nDCs undergo maturation in response to infection. This process involves the upregulation of MHC class II and co-stimulatory molecules, enhancing their capacity to present antigens to T cells. Additionally, mature DCs rely on CCR7-dependent migration to T-cell-rich zones within lymph nodes, where they efficiently present antigens to T cells.\nMoreover, mature DCs release cytokines that play a crucial role in promoting the differentiation of naïve antigen-specific T cells into effector cells. This coordinated response ensures the activation of adaptive immunity and the initiation of an effective immune response against invading pathogens.\n\n\n2.3.4 MHC Complexes\nMHC complexes play a pivotal role in immune surveillance and response. Dendritic cells (DCs), acting as tissue sentinels, continuously sample antigens from their local environment. They process these antigens for presentation to CD4+ T helper cells or CD8+ T cells on MHC class II or MHC I molecules, respectively.\n\n\n\n\n\nDIfferences Between MHC Molecules\n\n\n\n\nMHC class I and II molecules function by presenting peptides on the cell surface, where they can be recognized by T cells. Immunogenic peptides bound to MHC class I complexes are recognized by cytotoxic CD8 T cells, while those bound to MHC class II complexes are recognized by CD4 T cells.\nMHC class I molecules primarily present peptides derived from cytosolic proteolysis, providing a window into the intracellular environment. In contrast, MHC class II molecules predominantly sample the extracellular milieu by presenting antigens captured and processed within endolysosomal compartments. This distinction in antigen presentation enables the immune system to effectively surveil both intracellular and extracellular threats, contributing to the overall robustness of the immune response.\n\n2.3.4.1 Antigen Presentation on MHC II Proteins\n\n\n\n\n\nAntigen Presentation on MHC II Proteins\n\n\n\n\nAntigen presentation on MHC II molecules is a crucial step in the immune response against extracellular pathogens. The process begins when extracellular pathogens and proteins are internalized into endocytic vesicles within the cell.\nOnce inside the endocytic vesicles, these pathogens are degraded by activated intravesicular proteases, resulting in the generation of peptide fragments. These peptide fragments possess the capability to bind to MHC II molecules.\nMHC II molecules are initially synthesized and delivered to the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) membrane. From there, they are transported onward as part of membrane-enclosed vesicles that bud off the ER. These vesicles are directed to intracellular vesicles containing internalized antigens.\nWithin these intracellular vesicles, complexes are formed between the peptide fragments and MHC II molecules. These complexes are then transported to the cell surface, where they are presented to CD4 T cells.\n\n\n2.3.4.2 Antigen Presentation on MHC I Proteins\n\n\n\n\n\nAntigen Presentation on an MHC I Protein\n\n\n\n\nAntigen presentation on MHC I molecules offers a distinct pathway through which dendritic cells (DCs) handle antigens, particularly in response to viral infections. This process involves the direct entry of antigens into the cytosol of DCs, typically facilitated by viral infections.\nOnce inside the cytoplasm of DCs, viral proteins are synthesized, processed, and broken down in the proteasome. Subsequently, these peptides are presented on the cell surface as antigenic fragments loaded onto MHC I molecules. This loading process occurs after the peptides are transported into the endoplasmic reticulum (ER).\nTo achieve this, cytosolic peptides must traverse the ER membrane, facilitated by a transporter known as the MHC-encoded Transporter Associated with Antigen Processing (TAP) complex. The TAP complex is responsible for translocating cytosolic peptides across the ER membrane, allowing them to reach the ER lumen where the peptide-binding portion of MHC-I molecules is located.\nThis mechanism enables dendritic cells to efficiently present antigens to and activate naïve CD8 T cells. Subsequently, these activated CD8 T cells differentiate into cytotoxic effector CD8 T cells, which play a crucial role in recognizing and eliminating virus-infected cells.\n\n2.3.4.2.1 Cross Presentation\n\n\n\n\n\nCross Presentation\n\n\n\n\nAntigen presentation on MHC I molecules also involves a process known as cross-presentation, which is essential for the immune system’s ability to respond effectively to viral infections and other threats. This mechanism enables dendritic cells (DCs) to present antigens derived from extracellular sources on MHC I molecules, thereby activating CD8 T cells.\nCross-presentation occurs when DCs internalize extracellular virus particles or virus-infected cells through processes like micropinocytosis or phagocytosis. Once these materials enter the endocytic pathway, viruses can be processed for presentation on MHC I molecules.\nIn some cases, viruses taken up by DCs via endocytic or phagocytic vesicles are transported to the cytosol, where they undergo proteasomal degradation. Subsequently, viral peptides are transferred to the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) for loading onto MHC I molecules. This process allows DCs to effectively present viral antigens to CD8 T cells, initiating an immune response against the infection.\nImportantly, viruses that do not directly infect DCs can still stimulate the activation of CD8 T cells through cross-presentation.\n\n\n\n\n2.3.5 Cytokines and Chemokines\n\n\n\n\n\nDepiction of Chemokines and Cytokines\n\n\n\n\nCytokines and chemokines are vital signaling molecules released by cells, often in response to various stimuli triggering immune responses. Similar to hormones, they convey critical signals to other immune cells, playing pivotal roles in amplifying and regulating immune responses.\nThese small proteins exert their effects by binding to specific receptors on target cells, orchestrating various immune responses. Cytokines can act in different ways: in an autocrine manner, affecting the behavior of the cell that releases them; in a paracrine manner, influencing nearby cells; or even in an endocrine manner, where they are stable enough to act on distant cells.\nChemokines, a subtype of cytokines, function as chemoattractant molecules. They induce directed chemotaxis in nearby responsive cells, guiding the movement of cells toward the source of the chemokine. This directed movement plays a crucial role in processes such as inflammation and immune cell recruitment to sites of infection or tissue damage."

    "section": "2.4 Trained Memory",
    "text": "2.4 Trained Memory\nThe Bacillus Calmette-Guérin (BCG) vaccine, derived from an attenuated strain of Mycobacterium bovis, was developed in the 1920s to provide protection against tuberculosis, a widespread and deadly infectious disease at the time.\nRemarkably, epidemiological studies conducted shortly after its introduction revealed a fascinating phenomenon: the BCG vaccine seemed to reduce infant mortality rates even beyond its anticipated protection against tuberculosis. In fact, children vaccinated with BCG exhibited a significant 50% reduction in overall mortality, a profound effect that could not be solely attributed to its tuberculosis-preventing properties.\nFurther investigations suggested that the mortality reduction observed in BCG-vaccinated infants might stem from the induction of immunity against unrelated infectious agents. Surprisingly, BCG appeared to confer protection against a spectrum of pathogens beyond tuberculosis. Studies demonstrated its efficacy in protecting against various viral infections, including vaccinia virus, herpes simplex virus type 2, and influenza A virus.\nThis unexpected discovery of the broader protective effects of the BCG vaccine against diverse infectious agents paved the way for the concept of “trained immunity.” Trained immunity refers to the phenomenon wherein exposure to certain stimuli, such as the BCG vaccine, enhances the innate immune system’s ability to respond to subsequent infections, even those unrelated to the initial stimulus.\n\n2.4.1 What is Innate Immune Memory?\n\n\n\n\n\nDepiction of Innate Immune Memory\n\n\n\n\nInnate immune memory, also known as trained immunity, denotes a remarkable feature of the innate immune system wherein innate immune cells exhibit heightened responsiveness upon encountering microbial pathogens for a second time. This enhanced response includes increased production of inflammatory mediators and an augmented capacity to eliminate infections.\nThis functional adaptation of the innate immune system serves as a crucial defense mechanism against secondary infections. Importantly, innate immune memory provides protection not only against the same pathogen encountered previously but also against heterologous pathogens. This non-specific protection underscores the innate immune system’s ability to mount effective responses against a variety of microbial threats, contributing significantly to the body’s defense against infections.\n\n\n2.4.2 More on Trained Immunity\n\n\n\n\n\nTrained Immunity\n\n\n\n\nThe concept of long-term epigenetic reprogramming in innate immune cells underscores a fundamental aspect of their function. This process involves sustained alterations in transcriptional programs without permanent changes to the genetic code. Specifically, innate immune cells undergo modifications in histones, proteins that help package DNA into chromatin, resulting in long-term opening of chromatin at the promoters of genes encoding pro-inflammatory cytokines like IL-6, IL-1β, and TNF.\nThrough these epigenetic changes, innate immune cells establish a molecular memory of previous encounters with pathogens or immune stimuli. This memory enables them to respond more effectively upon subsequent exposures, initiating a rapid and robust inflammatory response against invading pathogens.\n\n\n\n\n\nDuration of Trained Immunity\n\n\n\n\nStudies have identified trained monocytes circulating in the bloodstreams of individuals vaccinated with BCG for at least 3 months post-vaccination. However, innate immune cells, despite their central role in this process, are short-lived and are unlikely to transmit the memory phenotype to their progeny to sustain long-term protection.\nInterestingly, the phenomenon of trained immunity occurs through dual mechanisms: within hematopoietic stem cells (HSCs) in the bone marrow, known as central trained immunity, and within differentiated immune cells in peripheral tissues, referred to as peripheral trained immunity. HSCs, characterized by their longevity and self-renewal capabilities, reside within the bone marrow. The training of HSCs enables pro-inflammatory epigenetic reprogramming, which can be passed down to their daughter cells. As these daughter cells differentiate into trained effector innate immune cells, they inherit the primed state, facilitating a heightened immune response upon encountering subsequent infections."

These cells are integral to the immune system’s ability to recognize and neutralize pathogens such as bacteria, viruses, and other harmful substances.\nOne of the primary functions of B cells is to produce antibodies, which are specialized proteins that can recognize and bind to specific antigens, such as those found on the surface of pathogens. When a B cell encounters its specific antigen, it undergoes activation and proliferation, leading to the generation of antibody-producing cells called plasma cells. These plasma cells then secrete large quantities of antibodies into the bloodstream, where they can target and neutralize pathogens, marking them for destruction by other immune cells.\nThe name “B cell” originated from studies conducted in birds, particularly chickens, where researchers identified a specialized organ called the Bursa of Fabricius as the primary site of B cell development and maturation. However, in mammals like humans and mice, B cells originate from precursor cells found in the bone marrow in adults or the fetal liver in embryos. These precursor cells undergo a series of differentiation and maturation steps within the bone marrow or fetal liver, eventually giving rise to mature B cells capable of responding to specific antigens encountered in the body."

They consist of two heavy chains and two light chains, each with distinct regions and functions.\n\nVariable Region: The variable region of an antibody, located at the antigen-binding site, is highly diverse and responsible for recognizing and binding to specific antigens. The process of generating this diversity involves V(D)J recombination, where gene segments encoding the variable regions of both heavy and light chains undergo rearrangement, resulting in a vast array of antigen-binding specificities.\nConstant Region: The constant region of an antibody, found in the heavy chains, determines the antibody’s isotype or class, such as IgM, IgD, IgG, IgE, or IgA. The process of class switching allows B cells to change the isotype of the antibodies they produce without changing the antigen specificity. This process occurs after B cell activation and involves recombination events that replace one constant region gene segment with another, leading to the production of antibodies with different effector functions.\n\nAntibodies are composed of two identical heavy chains and two identical light chains, held together by disulfide bonds. The heavy chains are encoded by the Igh gene, while the light chains can be either kappa (Igκ) or lambda (Igλ), encoded by the Igκ or Igλ genes, respectively.

Similar to the Igκ gene, the Igλ gene participates in V(D)J recombination to generate diverse variable regions.\n\nThrough V(D)J recombination, which occurs during B cell development in the bone marrow, a single B cell has the potential to produce a vast repertoire of antibodies, estimated to be between 108 to 1011 different antibodies.

This process ensures that each lymphocyte expresses only one type of antigen receptor, either B cell receptor (BCR) or T cell receptor (TCR), to maintain specificity in immune responses.\nIn the context of B cells:\n\nHeavy Chain Allelic Exclusion: During B cell development, rearrangement of the genes encoding the heavy chain of the BCR occurs on both chromosomes. If successful rearrangement occurs on one chromosome, it leads to the production of a functional heavy chain and subsequently the formation of the pre-B cell receptor (pre-BCR). This successful rearrangement triggers allelic exclusion on the second chromosome, effectively shutting down further rearrangement attempts on that chromosome. If rearrangement fails on the first chromosome, the cell attempts rearrangement on the second chromosome. If both attempts fail, the cell undergoes apoptosis (cell death).\nLight Chain Allelic Exclusion: After successful rearrangement of the heavy chain and expression of the pre-BCR, the B cell attempts rearrangement of the genes encoding the light chain (either Igκ or Igλ). The process of light chain rearrangement follows a similar pattern to heavy chain rearrangement, where successful rearrangement on one chromosome leads to allelic exclusion on the second chromosome. If no successful rearrangement occurs on either chromosome, the cell attempts rearrangement on the second chromosome. If both attempts fail, the cell undergoes apoptosis.\n\nThe mechanisms underlying allelic exclusion are not fully understood, but they involve regulatory processes that ensure only one functional antigen receptor is expressed per lymphocyte. It’s worth noting that allelic exclusion is very tight for heavy chain rearrangement (around 0.01% inclusion) and less tight for light chain rearrangement (approximately 1-10% inclusion). This tight regulation helps maintain the specificity and diversity of the immune system’s responses to various antigens.\n\n3.2.3.1 Dealing with Unwanted B Cell Receptors\n\n\n\n\n\nDealing with Unwanted B Cell Receptors\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDealing with Unwanted B Cell Receptors"

Here’s a summary of what happens to activated B cells:\n\nProliferation and Formation of Germinal Centers: Activated B cells proliferate rapidly within the primary follicles or migrate to primary follicles after activation. As they proliferate, they induce changes in the organization of the follicle. The primary follicle polarizes to become a secondary follicle, and within it, specialized structures called germinal centers are formed. Germinal centers are crucial for B cell differentiation and the generation of high-affinity antibodies.\nFormation of Mantle Zone: As activated B cells proliferate and form germinal centers, the naive B cells within the follicle are pushed to the periphery to form the mantle zone. The mantle zone consists of resting B cells that have not yet been activated by antigen encounter.\nContinued Proliferation and Differentiation: Within the germinal centers, activated B cells continue to proliferate and undergo somatic hypermutation and class switching, processes that enhance the diversity and functionality of antibodies produced by B cells. Additionally, B cells compete for T cell help and undergo selection processes to generate high-affinity antibodies.\nReceiving T Cell Help: Activated B cells require T cell help for optimal activation and differentiation. T helper cells, particularly follicular T helper (Tfh) cells, provide critical signals to B cells within germinal centers, including CD40 ligand (CD40L) and cytokines like interleukin-21 (IL-21). This T cell help is essential for driving B cell proliferation, affinity maturation, and differentiation into memory B cells or plasma cells.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMHCII Loading Using Antigens\n\n\n\n\n\n3.3.3.1 Germinal Center Formation\n\n\n\n\n\nFormation of a Germinal Center"

This process introduces point mutations at a high rate within the variable region of immunoglobulin genes. These mutations result in the generation of a diverse repertoire of antibodies with varying affinities for the antigen.\nClass Switching: AID also plays a central role in class switching, a process through which B cells change the constant region of their immunoglobulin heavy chain genes (IgH). This allows B cells to switch from producing IgM to other antibody isotypes such as IgG, IgA, or IgE, which have distinct effector functions. AID initiates class switching by deaminating cytosine residues in switch regions located upstream of the constant region genes. This process leads to DNA double-strand breaks and subsequent recombination events mediated by DNA repair enzymes, resulting in the replacement of one constant region with another.\n\nAID is highly specific to B cells and is tightly regulated to prevent off-target mutations and genomic instability. Despite its importance in adaptive immunity, dysregulation or mutations in the AID gene can lead to autoimmune diseases, immunodeficiencies, or even certain types of lymphocytes.\n\n\n\n\n\nSomatic Hypermuatation and Class Switching\n\n\n\n\nUridine, a nucleotide that is not typically found in DNA, can lead to specific consequences during DNA replication and repair processes.\n\nRecognition as Thymine: If uridine is incorporated into the DNA strand during replication, DNA polymerase may recognize it as thymine, as they share similar structures. Consequently, adenine may pair with the uridine, forming a C-G base pair. During subsequent rounds of replication, this C-G pair may be replaced by an A-T pair.\nRecognition as a Mistake: Alternatively, uridine may be recognized as an error by the DNA repair enzyme uracil DNA glycosylase (UNG). UNG removes the uracil base, leaving an abasic site, also known as an apurinic/apyrimidinic (AP) site.\nAbasic Site Formation: After the removal of the uracil base by UNG, an abasic site is created in the DNA strand. This site lacks a nucleotide base, leaving a gap in the DNA sequence.\nIncorporation of Nucleotides: During the next round of DNA replication, any nucleotide can potentially be incorporated into the complimentary strand opposite the abasic site. This means that the DNA polymerase may insert any of the four nucleotides (adenine, thymine, cytosine, or guanine) across from the abasic site, leading to potential mutations or alterations in the DNA sequence.\n\nSomatic hypermutation is a crucial process occurring in the germinal center of B cells, specifically within the rapidly dividing centroblasts. During somatic hypermutation, random mutations are introduced into the variable regions of the immunoglobulin genes, both in the heavy chain (VH) and light chain (VL). These mutations occur at a high frequency and are crucial for generating a diverse repertoire of antibodies with varying affinities for antigens.\nFollowing somatic hypermutation, the selection process for affinity maturation occurs in centrocytes, which are less proliferative than centroblasts. Centrocytes are B cells that have undergone somatic hypermutation and express mutated B cell receptors (BCRs) on their surface. The affinity maturation process is dependent on antigen binding.\nDuring affinity maturation, centrocytes interact with antigens presented by follicular dendritic cells (FDCs) within the germinal center. B cells with BCRs that have high affinity for the antigen receive survival signals from FDCs and are positively selected for further proliferation and differentiation. This selection process leads to the preferential expansion of B cell clones with BCRs that have higher affinities for the antigen.\n\n\n3.4.2 Different Antibody Isotopes\nLong story short, different antibodies have different effector functions and can serve different functions. This will be covered in a subsequent lecture. However, the way B-cell receptors generate different isotopes is called class switching.\n\n\n\n\n\nCytokines that Induce Class Switching\n\n\n\n\nClass switching is induced by a series of cytokines - this is because cytokines also induce germline transcription (and hence, also change the shape of the R-loop). Class switching also involves the AID enzyme mentioned earlier along with the following steps:\n\nDNA Breaking\n\n\n\n\n\nBreaking DNA\n\n\n\n\nGermline Transcription and Class Switching Induction by Cytokines\n\n\n\n\n\nInducing Transcription and Class Switching\n\n\n\n\nOne thing to note is that the class switching induced in this step is sequential.\n\n\n3.4.2.1 AID Mutations\n\n\n\n\n\nMajor Stages in B Cell Development\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMajor Stages in B Cell Development\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFACS Analysis on B Cells\n\n\n\n\nThe neat thing about B cells too is that they can be visualized using software like FlowJo (i.e., a tool used to visualize and analyze flow cytometry data)."

    "text": "What are physical barriers?\nThese are anatomical and physiological structures of the human body that behave as the first line of defense against pathogens. These structures are keystone in the innate immune system (which provide non-specific protection against pathogens) and include:\n\nMucosal membranes: mucous can trap and remove pathogens, and mucous can also be moved out of the body or swallowed and digested via cilia (i.e., tiny hairs that line the membranes and facilitate the movement of mucous).\nGastrointestinal tract: the environment in the digestive tract is acidic - this makes microbial challenging, plus hydrolytic enzymes like pepsin can also eliminate potential pathogens.\nSkin: the outermost layer of the skin - the epidermis - is made up of closely-compacted cells that are difficult for pathogens to penetrate. The skin also has sebaceous glands that secrete oil to make the skin a less hospitable place for pathogens.\n\nHow does the innate immune response transition to the adaptive immune response? What are the cell types involved?\nThis is how the process generally unfolds:\n\nInnate immune cells like macrophages and dendritic cells recognize and engulf pathogens using pattern recognition receptors. These receptors can pick up common patterns that are associated with pathogens - these are called pathogen-associated molecular patterns or PAMPS for short.\nThese innate immune cells then present fragments of the pathogens called antigens on their surfaces. The presentation happens through the MHC proteins.\nDendritic cells then migrate to the lymph nodes and present their antigens to T-cells\nThe T-cells are then activated and via T-cell receptor. The T-cells are then changed into helper (CD4) and cytotoxic (CD8) T-cells. The T-cells (helper ones) then activate B-cells.\nThe B-cells undergo clonal selection, differentiate into plasma cells, and produce antibodies.\n\nT-cells and B-cells die (most of them), a small proportion of them go on to turn into memory T and B cells.\n\nRed blood cells do not have an MHC class I protein, so how do they evade NK-mediated apoptosis?\nRed blood cells lack the markers that are necessary to trigger the release of lytic granules.\nIs it possible for the innate immune system to have a “memory”?\nRecent research have suggested that this is possible via a phenomenon called “innate immune memory” or “trained immunity” for short. This refers to the idea that certain cells of the innate immune system like macrophages and monocytes can undergo functional reprogramming or epigenetic changes (e.g., DNA methylation or histone modifications) when they encouter a pathogen or a specific stimulus. This “reprogramming” leads to a more efficient response against the same pathogen in the following infection.\nDo plants, insects, and fish have immune systems? Are they innate or adaptive?\nAll three entities do have immune systems, but they rely on innate immune mechanisms to defend against pathogens:\n\nPlants:\n\nPlants possess an innate immune system that involves both physical barriers and biochemical defense mechanisms. Physical barriers include the plant cell wall, which acts as a barrier against invading pathogens. Biochemical defenses involve the production of antimicrobial compounds, such as phytoalexins, and the activation of various signaling pathways in response to pathogen attack. Plant cells can recognize specific molecular patterns associated with pathogens, triggering a defense response.\n\nFish:\n\nFish have both innate and adaptive immune components. Their innate immune system involves physical barriers (skin and mucus), phagocytic cells (like macrophages), and antimicrobial peptides. Fish also have a primitive form of adaptive immunity, with lymphocytes similar to T cells and B cells in mammals, but lacking the complex immunoglobulin-based adaptive immune system. Instead, fish rely on a diverse array of receptors like immunoglobulin domains and lectins for immune recognition.\n\nInsects:\n\nInsects primarily rely on their innate immune system for defense. Their innate immune responses include physical barriers (cuticle and exoskeleton), cellular responses involving hemocytes (equivalent to blood cells in vertebrates) with phagocytic activity, and the production of antimicrobial peptides. Insects lack the adaptive immune system present in vertebrates."
